All of the included textures can be found in the game already.

The only ones included in the Backgrounds folder are those that needed to be edited.

The Elite and Rare textures were taken from Discord Art.  Loz or someone else photoshopped them 
out of the unit frames.

The two endcaps are only found in the game for the left side (the game flips them for your action
bars).  So I flipped them and included the right side versions so you can use both.
